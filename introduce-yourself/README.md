# Introduce Yourself

The simplest way to contribute to this repo.

Just create a file (`Your-Name.md` or `Your-Name.txt`) here and write down whatever comes to your mind, introducing yourself. Commit and create a PR. Have fun!

**Please note:** Any PRs from this folder will be marked `invalid` during October and will not count towards Hacktoberfest as:

> _High-quality contributions are part of the the core values of Hacktoberfest, and quickly gaining a PR towards completing the challenge will not be fair._

That said, you may freely use this folder to introduce yourself and learn about Git and GitHub.

Thanks for understanding!
